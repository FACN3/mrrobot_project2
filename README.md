# mrrobot_project2 :To-do List

## What
- Created a to-do list with 'add task', 'delete' and 'checkbox' function.

## Why
- To practice creating pure functions and testing them.
- To practice working with DOM and javascript.
- So we can plan out our day wisely using the to-do list.

## How
- We worked on one laptop and ping-pong coded, so we could go over the codes together at the same time.
- Used TDD to create the logic needed.
- Put minimal time on styling so we could invest more time on functionality.
